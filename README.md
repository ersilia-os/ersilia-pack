# Ersilia-Pack

Ersilia-Pack is a FastAPI-based package designed to seamlessly serve your Ersilia model repository. It provides a comprehensive suite of APIs to monitor, execute, and manage model jobs, alongside detailed metadata support.

---

## *Release note for v1.1.0*

Enhanced caching control via cache_mode
- The /run endpoint now accepts a new cache_mode parameter (alongside fetch_cache, save_cache, and cache_only) so you can fine-tune exactly how results are saved to Redis, fetched from Redis, or forced through compute-only logic. This makes it easy to switch between full caching, fetch-only, save-only, or bypassing the cache altogether without touching your client code.

- Resilient Redis operations with safe fallbacks
All Redis calls (`HMGET`, `HSET`, `GET`, `SETEX`, pipeline expirations) are now wrapped in try/except blocks that log warnings on failure, keep the configured REDIS_EXPIRATION, and silently fall back to computing.

## Installation

Install the package directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia-pack.git
```

---

## Usage

Validate your model repository structure by running:

```bash
ersilia_model_lint --repo_path $REPO_PATH
```

Pack your model repository—supporting pip, conda, or both—using:

```bash
ersilia_model_pack --repo_path $REPO_PATH --bundles_repo_path $BUNDLE_PATH
```

For models with conda dependencies, specify a particular conda environment:

```bash
ersilia_model_pack --repo_path $REPO_PATH --bundles_repo_path $BUNDLE_PATH --conda_env_name $CONDA_ENV
```

After packaging, serve the application with:

```bash
ersilia_model_serve --bundle_path $BUNDLE_PATH --port $PORT
```

## Code Quality

To keep our codebase clean and consistent, we use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks alongside [Ruff](https://github.com/astro-build/ruff) as our linter/formatter.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed, then:

```bash
pip install pre-commit ruff
```

## Output Orientation

API responses are always provided in JSON format, following the Pandas DataFrame `orient` syntax. Supported output orientations include:
- **records:** Each row is output as a dictionary.
- **split:** Returns separate lists for index, columns, and data.
- **columns:** Outputs a dictionary with column names as keys and lists of values as entries.
- **index:** Outputs a dictionary with indices mapping to corresponding row data.
- **values:** Outputs a list of lists, with each sublist representing a row.

For more details, please refer to the [Pandas to_json documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html).

| **Real-time Health Monitoring**  | Monitors system performance—including CPU and memory usage and circuit breaker metrics—to ensure reliable service operations.                               |
| **Flexible Metadata Access**     | Provides endpoints to retrieve complete metadata or specific metadata fields, offering a clear view of model details such as name, title, and description. |
| **Comprehensive Run Endpoints**  | Facilitates example data retrieval for both input and output, along with dynamic job execution, enabling easy testing and validation of model predictions. |
| **Multiple Output Formats**      | Supports various output orientations (records, split, columns, index, and values) based on Pandas DataFrame `to_json` syntax, allowing flexible JSON responses. |

## For Developers

- **Input Handling:**  
  Currently, only `"Compound"` and `"Single"` input types are supported. To accommodate additional types, update the schemas within the `templates/input_schemas` directory.

- **Best Practices:**  
  Follow standard FastAPI conventions. Ensure that any new features are well-documented and thoroughly tested.

- **Extensibility:**  
  The modular design of Ersilia-Pack allows you to easily integrate new endpoints and custom logic to extend functionality as needed.
